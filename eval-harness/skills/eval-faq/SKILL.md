---

## Purpose

Answer any question about eval methodology, grader types, dataset design, criteria writing, non-determinism, tool-call evaluation, multi-turn agent evaluation, eval tooling, capability vs. regression evals, and interpreting results — specifically in the context of AI agent evaluation. Guidance is grounded primarily in **Microsoft's agent evaluation documentation** (MS Learn agent evaluation pages, the Eval Scenario Library, the Triage & Improvement Playbook, and the Eval Guidance Kit), supplemented by select industry sources for topics Microsoft does not cover deeply. The knowledge base includes a **Camp AIR harness quick reference** section that answers harness-specific questions without requiring a network fetch.

**Fetch rules:**
- Always attempt the fetch for rows without "Do NOT fetch." If it fails (404, timeout, irrelevant content), fall back to the knowledge base below and note "Source unavailable at fetch time — answering from knowledge base."
- **Microsoft sources take priority.** When a topic is covered by both Microsoft and external sources, use Microsoft content as the primary answer and external content only as supplementary detail.
- Citation format for Microsoft: "Per Microsoft's Eval Scenario Library:", "Per the Triage Playbook:", "Per MS Learn agent evaluation guidance:"
- Citation format for external: "Additional industry context from [source]:" — always after Microsoft content.
- Never block on a failed fetch. A degraded answer is better than no answer.
- Extract only the section relevant to the question. Do not summarize the whole page.

### Step 2 — Answer using fetched content plus knowledge base

Synthesize the fetched content with the knowledge base below. Microsoft fetched content takes priority, then knowledge base, then external sources.

**Answer style rules — no exceptions:**
- Answer in 3-5 sentences maximum. No padding, no preamble, no "great question."
- Give opinionated, direct guidance. Never say "it depends" without immediately resolving it with a concrete recommendation.
- Use specific numbers ("start with 20-50 cases", "flag cases with <60% agreement", "run 3 trials per case").
- Reference the harness structure when relevant: "put this in the `expected` block", "use the `--tags` flag", "set `trials: 3` in your eval config."
- Do not ask clarifying questions. Make a reasonable assumption and answer.
- Cite which source you used at the end of the answer.

## Knowledge Base

Use the sections below as your primary reference when fetched content does not cover the question, or to supplement fetched content with harness-specific details.

### Camp AIR harness quick reference

This section is the authoritative source for all questions about the Camp AIR eval harness. Use it directly — no network fetch required.

#### Eval file structure

Each eval file is a YAML or JSON file defining an `EvalConfig` object. The required and optional top-level fields are:

```yaml
name: "my-eval"                  # required — short identifier
description: "What this tests"   # required — one sentence
dataset: "datasets/my-cases.json" # required — path relative to my-evals/
grader: "my-grader"              # required — grader name or inline grader config
tags: ["capability", "tone"]     # optional — used with --tags flag to filter runs
trials: 1                        # optional — number of times to run each case (default 1; use 3 for non-determinism testing)
```

Put custom eval files in the `my-evals/` directory. Put dataset files in `my-evals/datasets/`.

#### Dataset case format

Each case in your dataset is a JSON object with these fields:

```json
{
  "id": "case-001",              // required — unique string identifier
  "input": "User message here",  // required — the input sent to the agent
  "expected": {                  // required — the criteria this case must meet
    "max_length": 400,           // optional — response must be at most N characters
    "must_include_topic": "refund policy", // optional — response must mention this topic
    "must_not_include": "sorry", // optional — response must NOT contain this string
    "min_score": 0.7,            // optional — minimum LLM judge score (0.0–1.0)
    "expected_content": "..."    // optional — reference answer for reference-aware judging
  },
  "tags": ["happy-path", "tone"] // optional — used with --tags flag
}
```

The `expected` block is your criterion definition. You can combine multiple fields — e.g., both `max_length` and `must_include_topic` — and all must pass for the case to pass.

#### Key CLI flags

| Flag | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--file my-evals/my-eval.yaml` | Run a specific eval file |
| `--tags capability` | Run only cases tagged with this value |
| `--verbose` | Print each case result with full transcript |
| `--ci` | Exit with non-zero code on any failure (use in CI pipelines) |

#### Where to put files

- Custom eval configs: `my-evals/my-eval-name.yaml`
- Dataset files: `my-evals/datasets/my-dataset.json`
- Do not modify files outside `my-evals/` during the workshop

#### Threshold guidelines (Camp AIR defaults)

| Pass rate | Decision |
|---|---|
| 85% or above | SHIP — agent meets the bar for this capability |
| 60–84% | ITERATE — meaningful failures exist; fix before shipping |
| Below 60% | BLOCK — fundamental problem; do not ship this capability |

These thresholds apply to capability evals on customer-facing tasks. For internal tools, the ITERATE threshold drops to 70%. For safety-critical tasks, the SHIP threshold rises to 95%.

**If 100% of cases pass on your first run:** your cases are too easy. Add harder edge and adversarial cases immediately. 100% on day one is a red flag, not a success.

#### Minimum viable eval for the 40-minute workshop

If you are running out of time, this is the minimum set that provides real signal:
1. 3-5 happy-path cases covering the core use case
2. 2-3 edge cases (empty input, very long input, ambiguous input)
3. 1-2 adversarial cases (out-of-scope request, prompt injection attempt)
4. At least one `must_not_include` criterion to catch obvious failures

That is 6-10 cases. Run with `--verbose` so you can read each result. Fix the first failure you find, re-run, repeat.

### Microsoft's 4-stage iterative evaluation framework

Per MS Learn agent evaluation guidance, evaluation follows four stages:

1. **Define** — Establish the agent's purpose, scope, quality signals, and success criteria before writing any eval cases. Use the agent profile template from the Eval Scenario Library to document scope.
2. **Set Baseline & Iterate** — Run initial evals, establish a baseline score, then iterate on the agent (prompt, tools, model) until scores improve. The Triage Playbook's Layer 1 (Score Interpretation) tells you whether to SHIP, ITERATE, or BLOCK at each checkpoint.
3. **Systematic Expansion** — Expand eval coverage across the 11 scenario validation themes. Add edge cases, adversarial cases, and cross-signal patterns. Use the Scenario Library's 5 business-problem + 9 capability scenario types as a coverage checklist.
4. **Operationalize** — Integrate evals into CI/CD, set up production monitoring, and establish the eval flywheel (production failures become eval cases within 24 hours).

**Target pass rates per stage:** Per the Eval Scenario Library: Overall >=85%, Core business >=90%, Safety >=95%, Edge cases >=70-80%.

### Scenario types

Per Microsoft's Eval Scenario Library, scenarios divide into two categories:

**5 Business-Problem scenarios** (test whether the agent solves the real user problem):
- **Information Retrieval** — Agent finds and delivers the right information from knowledge sources.
- **Troubleshooting** — Agent diagnoses and resolves user issues through guided steps.
- **Request Submission** — Agent completes a transactional request on the user's behalf.
- **Process Navigation** — Agent guides users through multi-step workflows.
- **Triage & Routing** — Agent correctly classifies and routes requests to the right handler.

**9 Capability scenarios** (test a specific isolated ability):
- Knowledge Grounding, Tool Invocations, Trigger Routing, Compliance, Safety & Boundary, Tone, Graceful Failure, Regression, Red-Teaming.

**Anti-pattern:** Skewing your dataset 80%+ toward happy-path cases. Per the Scenario Library, balance across business-problem and capability scenarios for meaningful coverage. Target roughly 50% happy-path, 30% edge cases, 20% adversarial.

### Quality signals

Per Microsoft's Eval Scenario Library, five quality signals define agent quality:

1. **Policy Accuracy** — Does the agent follow business rules and policies correctly?
2. **Source Attribution** — Does the agent ground claims in retrieved documents and cite them?
3. **Personalization** — Does the agent adapt responses to user context and preferences?
4. **Action Enablement** — Does the agent empower users to take the next step?
5. **Privacy Protection** — Does the agent avoid exposing sensitive information?

Each quality signal maps to specific evaluation methods (Keyword Match, Compare Meaning, Tool Use, General Quality) via the method mapping tables in the Scenario Library.

### 7 test methods (Copilot Studio)

Per MS Learn agent evaluation guidance, seven test methods cover different evaluation needs:

1. **General Quality** — LLM-judge evaluation across sub-dimensions: Relevance, Groundedness, Completeness, Abstention. Use for open-ended quality assessment. Target 80-90% pass rate.
2. **Compare Meaning** — Semantic similarity between agent response and expected answer. Use when the meaning matters but exact wording does not.
3. **Tool Use** — Validates the agent invoked the correct tools with correct parameters. Use for agentic workflows with tool calls.
4. **Keyword Match** — Checks for presence or absence of specific keywords. Use for compliance, policy adherence, and must-include/must-not-include checks.
5. **Text Similarity** — Lexical/embedding-based similarity scoring. Use when response phrasing matters.
6. **Exact Match** — Strict string equality. Use for classification, routing labels, and structured outputs.
7. **Custom** — User-defined evaluation logic. Use when none of the built-in methods fit.

In the harness: these map to `expected` block fields — `must_include_topic` (Keyword Match), `expected_content` with similarity (Compare Meaning), `min_score` (General Quality).

### Evaluation approaches

Per MS Learn (common-evaluation-approaches), three approaches for generating test interactions:

- **Echo** — Replay exact user inputs and compare outputs to expected results. Simplest; good for regression testing.
- **Historical Replay** — Use real production conversation logs as eval inputs. Best signal for production-realistic coverage.
- **Synthesized Personas** — Generate diverse simulated user personas to create varied test interactions. Best for coverage expansion when production logs are limited.

### Score interpretation and triage (Triage Playbook)

Per the Triage Playbook, score interpretation follows a 4-layer framework:

**Layer 1 — Score Interpretation:** Apply risk-based thresholds and the readiness decision tree:
- **SHIP** — Scores meet thresholds across all quality signals.
- **ITERATE** — Some signals below threshold; targeted fixes needed.
- **BLOCK** — Critical signals failing; do not ship.

**Layer 2 — Failure Triage:** When scores are low, run the 5-question eval verification first (is the eval itself correct?) before blaming the agent. Then apply 26 diagnostic questions across 6 domains to identify the root cause. Seven eval setup failure sub-types cover common grader/dataset bugs.

**Layer 3 — Remediation Mapping:** Each quality signal has specific remediation actions. Watch for the instruction budget problem — adding instructions to fix one signal can degrade another.

**Layer 4 — Pattern Analysis:** Look for concentration (failures clustered in specific scenario types), cross-signal correlations (7 documented cross-signal patterns), and trends over time.

**3 Root Cause Types:** Every failure traces to one of: (1) Eval Setup Issue — the eval itself is wrong, (2) Agent Configuration Issue — the agent needs fixing, (3) Platform Limitation — a constraint outside your control. Per the Triage Playbook, always rule out eval setup issues first — a significant portion of failures in new evals turn out to be grader bugs, not agent bugs.

### Non-determinism

Per the Triage Playbook: agents are non-deterministic. Run a minimum of 3 trials per case. Score variance of +/-5% across runs is normal. Variance of +/-10% or more requires investigation — either the eval is flaky or the agent has a genuine instability.

**Additional industry context from Anthropic:** pass@k ("succeeded at least once in k runs") vs. pass^k ("succeeded every time in k runs") diverge massively at scale. At k=10 with 70% per-trial success: pass@k is approximately 97%, pass^k is approximately 3%. The same agent looks excellent or catastrophic depending on which metric you report. For customer-facing agents, pass^k is the right question. A 0% pass@100 is almost always a task specification problem, not an agent problem — fix the task definition before blaming the model.

In the harness: set `trials: 3` in your eval config. Require 2/3 passes as your starting point.

### Red-teaming

Per Microsoft's Eval Scenario Library, red-teaming uses the **Probe-Measure-Harden** framework:

1. **Probe** — Run adversarial attacks including prompt injection, XPIA (cross-prompt injection attacks), encoding attacks, and role-playing exploitation.
2. **Measure** — Track Attack Success Rate (ASR) metrics per category.
3. **Harden** — Fix vulnerabilities, add guardrails, re-probe.

**Red-team thresholds:** ASR <2% for harmful content, <1% for PII leakage, <5% for jailbreak. Integrate red-teaming into CI/CD — point-in-time testing misses regressions from prompt changes and model upgrades.

**Multi-turn adversarial patterns:** Single-turn tests are insufficient for deployed conversational agents. Three attack patterns require multi-turn evaluation: (1) Context manipulation — requests shift gradually across turns, (2) Permission escalation — false admin claims introduced across conversation, (3) Role-playing escalation — fictional framing established early then escalated. Include at least 2-3 multi-turn adversarial scenarios in any eval suite.

### Grader types

Per MS Learn (common-evaluation-approaches), three grader categories:

- **Code-based / deterministic graders** (regex, string matching, JSON schema validation, length checks): Fast, cheap, unambiguous. Run these first. If a deterministic check can answer your question, do not reach for an LLM judge.
- **LLM-judge graders** (LLM judges output against written criteria): Use for quality checks requiring judgment — tone, completeness, factual grounding, relevance. Write criteria in plain language before writing grader code.
- **Human graders**: Slowest and highest quality. Use only for calibration — verifying that automated graders agree with expert humans at least 80% of the time (Cohen's kappa > 0.6).

**Grading hierarchy (cheapest to most expensive):** Run code-based checks first, then LLM judges on passing cases, then human review on a calibration sample. Per the Scenario Library, the 4 evaluation methods (Keyword Match, Compare Meaning, Tool Use, General Quality) map to these grader categories.

**Calibration threshold:** If your LLM judge and a human expert agree on fewer than 80% of cases (kappa < 0.6), your criteria are ambiguous. Rewrite criteria before trusting scores.

### Dataset design

Per the Eval Scenario Library, use the `eval-set-template.md` to structure your dataset. Use the `eval-generation-prompt.md` template to generate cases from an agent profile.

- Start with 20-50 cases for a focused task. Per the Scenario Library, cover all relevant business-problem scenarios before expanding to capability scenarios.
- Use the agent profile template (`agent-profile-template.yaml`) to define scope before writing cases.
- Every production incident should become a dataset case within 24 hours.
- Datasets are living artifacts. A frozen dataset is a regression suite, not an eval.
- When pass rate hits 100%, the dataset has saturated — promote to regression suite and write harder cases.

**Scoring conventions:** Standardize scoring across your eval suite from the start. Choose ONE convention (binary pass/fail, numeric 0-1, or numeric 0-10) and normalize across all evaluators. For workshop agents, binary pass/fail is the correct default. Per the 7 test methods, General Quality uses sub-dimension scoring while Keyword Match and Exact Match are inherently binary.

### Criteria writing

- Criteria must be specific enough that two people reading them independently would agree on pass or fail. Per the Triage Playbook's Layer 2, ambiguous criteria are a top eval setup failure sub-type.
- Bad: "the response is helpful." Good: "the response is under 300 characters and mentions the refund policy by name."
- Write criteria before writing code. If you cannot write a testable criterion, you do not understand what the agent should do.
- In the harness, criteria map to the `expected` block.
- **One dimension per score.** Do not combine factuality, tone, and conciseness into a single score. Multi-dimension composite scores hide regressions.
- **Avoid Likert scales (1-5).** Use binary pass/fail. Binary forces clarity. If you must use multi-point, cap at 3: fail / partial / pass.
- **Version your grader prompts.** A grader change produces incomparable scores. Track grader versions alongside dataset versions.

### Eval-driven development

Per MS Learn's 4-stage framework, evaluation starts at Stage 1 (Define) before the agent is built:

- Write eval cases that define the target capability BEFORE the agent can fulfill them.
- Run the eval — the agent should fail most cases initially. Low scores are expected and correct.
- Iterate on the agent (prompt, tools, model) until pass rate crosses your threshold.
- The day you hit your threshold, you ship.

**Anti-pattern:** Writing evals after building the feature. That produces evals calibrated to what you built, not what you intended.

### Transcript reading and error analysis

Per the Triage Playbook (Layer 2), never trust a score you have not manually verified. The 5-question eval verification asks: Is the test set correct? Is the grader measuring the right thing? Is the expected answer actually right? Is the agent getting the right context? Is the eval environment matching production?

**Axial coding process for failure analysis:**
1. Run your eval. Collect all failures.
2. Read each failure. Write a one-sentence label for the root cause.
3. Group labels into 3-5 categories (use the Triage Playbook's 6 diagnostic domains as a starting framework).
4. Count frequency per category. Sort descending.
5. Fix the highest-frequency category first. Re-run. Repeat.

Per the Triage Playbook, always include "grader error" as a category — many failures in new evals are grader bugs, not agent bugs.

**Additional industry context from Hamel Husain:** The axial coding methodology and "highest ROI activity in AI engineering" framing come from Hamel Husain's error analysis work. His key insight: most practitioners skip categorization and jump to "fix the prompt," missing structural patterns.

### Tool-call evaluation

Per the Eval Scenario Library's Tool Invocations capability scenario and MS Learn's Tool Use test method:

- **Three questions per tool invocation:** (1) Was it the right tool? (2) Were arguments correct and complete? (3) Was the invocation necessary?
- Do not grade tool-call sequences rigidly. Grade outcomes, not paths. If the agent reached the right answer via a different tool sequence, that should pass.
- Unnecessary tool calls are a cost and latency issue in production. Catch them in eval.
- In the harness: add a `tool_calls` field to your `expected` block. Verify count and type.

### Multi-turn and trajectory evaluation

Per MS Learn's evaluation approaches, multi-turn workflows require conversation-level evaluation, not turn-level:

- **Trajectory scoring:** Evaluate the sequence of steps as a whole. Did the agent take the shortest reasonable path? Did it recover from intermediate errors?
- **Environment state verification:** Ground truth is the state of the external environment, not what the agent claims. A booking agent passes if the reservation exists in the database.
- **Compounding errors:** A mistake at step 2 may not be visible in the final output. Run evals with detailed logging at each step.
- **Stateful interaction evaluation:** A turn-level pass rate of 90% can hide a conversation-level failure rate of 40%.

### Eval for agentic workflows

Per MS Learn's evaluation frameworks (11 scenario validation themes):

- Test each component individually first, then evaluate end-to-end. Component-level failures compound in pipelines.
- Orchestration-level failures are the most common missed failure mode. A pipeline where all components score 95% individually can still fail end-to-end at 40-60%.
- Use simulated environments for eval. Never run evals against production systems.
- Monitor intermediate outputs with validators at each pipeline step.

### Swiss cheese model of eval coverage

No single eval method catches every failure. Per the Eval Scenario Library's 4 evaluation methods and the Triage Playbook's multi-layer approach:

- Code-based graders catch structural failures but miss semantic ones.
- LLM judges catch semantic failures but have systematic biases.
- Human review catches subtle judgment failures but is too slow for full coverage.
- Production monitoring catches real-world distribution failures.
- **Layer all four.** Run deterministic checks first (cheapest), then LLM judges, then human calibration, then production monitoring.

### LLM-as-judge calibration

Per MS Learn's General Quality test method, LLM judges evaluate across sub-dimensions (Relevance, Groundedness, Completeness, Abstention). Calibrate judges against these defined dimensions.

**Additional industry context from Eugene Yan (bias data):**
- **Position bias:** GPT-3.5 biased toward first option 50% of the time; Claude-v1 biased 70%. Mitigate by evaluating both orderings.
- **Self-enhancement bias:** GPT-4 rates own outputs 10% higher; Claude-v1 rates own outputs 25% higher. Never use a model to judge its own outputs.
- **Verbosity bias:** Both models preferred longer responses >90% of the time. Include explicit length-independence instructions in judge prompts.

**Additional industry context from Hamel Husain (critique shadowing):**
When building LLM judges from scratch, use the 7-step Critique Shadowing methodology: (1) Identify one expert, (2) Create diverse dataset, (3) Collect binary pass/fail with written critiques, (4) Fix obvious errors, (5) Build judge prompts iteratively using expert examples, (6) Error analysis on disagreements, (7) Build specialized judges for specific failure modes. Target >90% agreement with domain expert before production use.

### Knowledge grounding (for RAG agents)

Per the Eval Scenario Library's Knowledge Grounding capability scenario and the Source Attribution quality signal:

- Knowledge grounding score measures whether each factual claim is supported by retrieved context.
- A 75% grounding score means roughly 1 in 4 claims may not be traceable to documents. Set threshold at 90%+ for high-stakes factual tasks.
- Low grounding score almost always means the retrieval step is failing, not the generation step. Fix chunking and retrieval before tuning the prompt.
- In the harness: use General Quality's Groundedness sub-dimension or implement a reference-aware judge with `expected_content`.

### Production continuity

Per MS Learn's 4-stage framework (Stage 4: Operationalize), eval is not a pre-launch gate — it is a continuous loop:

- Integrate evals into CI/CD. Run the full suite on every PR that changes system prompts, tool definitions, or agent behavior.
- Every production incident becomes a dataset case within 24 hours.
- **The eval flywheel:** production logs -> eval cases -> eval run -> findings -> agent fix -> production.
- Ship with monitoring, not just evals. The eval tells you the agent worked on test cases. Monitoring tells you it works on real user inputs.

**When the agent passes evals but fails in production:** Per the Triage Playbook, this is almost always a distribution mismatch. Pull 20 recent production failures. Check whether any would fail against your current eval dataset. If none would, your dataset needs production cases, not a better prompt.

### Interpreting results

Per the Triage Playbook's readiness decision tree:

- **SHIP** (>=85% overall, >=90% core business, >=95% safety): Agent meets the bar.
- **ITERATE** (60-84%): Meaningful failures exist. Use Layer 2 (Failure Triage) to diagnose.
- **BLOCK** (<60%): Fundamental problem. Do not ship.

Per the Triage Playbook's Layer 4 (Pattern Analysis): look for failure concentration in specific scenario types, cross-signal correlations, and trends over time. When a grader's verdict disagrees with your intuition, investigate — either the grader is wrong (fix the criterion) or your intuition is wrong (update your mental model).

### Capability evals vs. regression suites

- **Capability evals** measure what the agent can do. They start at low pass rates — a 30% rate on a new capability eval is useful signal, not a failure. Per the Eval Scenario Library, capability scenarios test isolated abilities.
- **Regression suites** maintain near-100% pass rate to detect degradation. Per the Scenario Library's Regression capability scenario type, these protect against backsliding.
- **When to promote:** When a capability eval saturates (consistently 90%+), promote those cases to the regression suite and write harder capability cases.
- In the harness: capability evals belong in `--tags capability`, regression evals in `--tags regression`. Never mix them — they have opposite pass-rate expectations.

### Eval tooling (supplementary)

For tooling questions, the primary recommendation is the Camp AIR eval harness for workshop use and Microsoft's Copilot Studio evaluation features for production Copilot agents. For teams needing third-party platforms:

- **Braintrust:** Good default for production agents. Free tier handles 1M spans/month.
- **LangSmith:** Best if already using LangChain. Native tracing.
- **Langfuse:** Best for self-hosted, data-sovereign setups. MIT-licensed.
- **Key warning:** Beware tools that auto-create rubrics AND auto-score without human calibration. The tool should support human review in the loop.
